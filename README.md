# Deadpool
*Our hero took the name Deadpool during the time he was experimented on:  
The guards had a dead pool and gambled on which test subject would die next...  
By the way, in the comics, the white boxes are Deadpool's crazy alternative inner voice.*

Deadpool is a repository of various public white-box cryptographic implementations and their practical attacks.

The DCA attacks are leveraged by Tracer and Daredevil projects, also available at https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/,
as outlined in the paper

Attacks presented in the paper were performed partly with a proprietary tool, that we are in the process of replacing by
an opensource variant (Daredevil) in order to have a completely opensource toolchain.
Therefore this repository doesn't contain yet all the attacks described in the paper.
More will come soon, missing features will be implemented in Daredevil to support all described attacks.
