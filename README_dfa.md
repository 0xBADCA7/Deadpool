# Differential Fault Analysis

The DFA attacks are leveraged by two components:

 * this Deadpool project which provides
   * the ```deadpool_dfa.py``` script, see below;
   * several examples of applied DFA attacks agains white-box implementations.
 * [the JeanGrey project](https://github.com/SideChannelMarvels/JeanGrey), able to perform DFA attacks against faulty outputs.

# ```deadpool_dfa.py```

```deadpool_dfa.py``` is a Python 3 library to help acquiring faulty outputs.
